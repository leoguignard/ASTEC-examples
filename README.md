# ASTEC-examples

This repository contains the notebook that was used to generate most of the figures of the following article: [Contact-dependent cell communications drive morphological invariance during ascidian embryogenesis](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/12/24/238741)

**It is important to notice that the notebook will not work without the datasets that should be manually included in the folder Data**

The datasets are not included in this repository for space reasons. They can be accessed and downloaded at https://figshare.com/s/765d4361d1b073beedd5.

## I - CONTENTS OF THE  REPOSITORY
  - ASTEC-JupyterNotebook.ipynb: the notebook which expose some examples on how to handle t
  - Data: folder place-holder where the necessary datas to build the figures should be placed
  - LICENCE: the licence terms you accept by using the notebook
  - README.md: this file 
  - useful_functions.py: Set of useful functions to handle the data and make figures. Some of them are used in this notebook

## II - INSTALLATION AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
In order to be able to run the notebook you need to install several packages:
  * python 2.7 or higher
    - Installation : Should be installed, use the command line `python -V` to get the installed version or visit https://www.python.org/
  * numpy,scipy,matplotlib, different scientific packages for python  (http://www.numpy.org, http://www.scipy.org, http://matplotlib.org)
  * jupyter notebook, a open-source framework to share code (http://jupyter.org)

## III - RUNNING ASTEC-examples
The code is written in python and can easly be run with a web interface using a Notebook (http://jupyter.org). 

You can find a user interface tutorial here (http://jupyter.cs.brynmawr.edu/hub/dblank/public/Jupyter%20Notebook%20Users%20Manual.ipynb)

To start the notebook, open a terminal and  run the command `jupyter notebook path/to/Package/ASTEC-JupyterNotebook.ipynb`
